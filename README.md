# Hotel Reservations
A console application with the functionality of a reservation system.

Any user that wishes to make a reservation will have a personal profile. When a reservation is made the user will be notified by an email. The profile will also have a history of all the reservations the user has ever made. If the user is a regular customer(having more than 5 reservations) he/she will get a discount.

The customers can make a reservation by choosing a date of arrival and departure, the capacity of the room and if they have any special requirements(like lower/higher floor, single/double beds etc.) they will be taken into account.
If there are enough rooms for the next few days then reservations can be made at the reception of the hotel.

Users are able to decline a reservation but if it is one day before the arrival 100% of their fisrt night will be taken from their accounts.

The system will have an algorythm to figure out a way for maximum rooms to be filled at the same time.
